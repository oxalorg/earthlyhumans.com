## Let's play detective

![](/img/detective.png)

We have, on an average, 7 minutes of your time before you leave
this page and we can no longer jam an impression on you. But we
feel that your time is valuable, so here we go.

### Earthly Humans

We've grown accustomed to view everything from our tiny modern
life bubble. We've grown so dependent on technology,
entertainment, and social media that we've forgotten to live.
When was the last time you were bored and you had nothing to do?
How many posts do you read on your social feed daily? and how
much of it actually makes you feel good?

Earthly Humans is a self exploring journey and an initiative to
make lives more meaningful, by allowing people to connect,
understand, and enjoy the melodic convergence of earth and
humans. This is our visison, but we'll execute it differently.

We believe that simple is better than complicated, and that less
is actually more. So we won't be wasting your time with fluff,
instead we'll use a serene combination of thoughts and art to
convey our message.

### WE not ME

I keep using 'we', instead of 'me' because I want to encourage
anyone to come and [help in this effort](/support)
