## Show us some love <3

Currently we remain ad-free, and I will be paying the bills out
of my own pockets. But you're welcome to help us pay our server
and hosting bills by leaving a small donation ($6 will cover our
monthly expenses).

You can also support us

* by spreading the word. Share our initiative with humans you care about!
* by sending feedback at
